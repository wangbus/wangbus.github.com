title: Startup Weekend, etc

Attended Startup Weekend Honolulu, got almost no sleep the entire weekend but finished a working prototype that got deployed. Although we didn't win, just doing that alone was extremely rewarding. I felt like the event was a really great way to connect entrepreneurs to the technical group. It's easy to get lost in thinking about technical implementation without really thinking about the big picture. I had a ton of fun and I learned so much from being a contestant.
