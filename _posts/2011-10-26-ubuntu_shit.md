title: Ubuntu Shit 
---

Wow really? Yeah I called it shit. 11.10 was the worst update ever. I had a lot of faith in this OS in the past but the update this time was absolutely horrendous. Video drivers didn't work on a _clean install_. Totally unacceptable. I had no idea.

So what happened after that? It's funny how one bad thing leads to... well... good things. The following things pissed me off -- graphics card driver (had to default to the open source version called nouveau) and Unity (I'd actually use this if it was more configurable and minimalistic). So guess what? I started going back to tiling WMs - sudo apt-get install awesome

Best thing I've done on Linux up to date. Fuck the themes, fuck the gradient, tiling window managers ftw. If I want nice graphics I'll just use OS X. But when I'm on Linux, minimalistic is the way to go. /rant
